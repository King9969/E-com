## 🔧 Customization

### Adding Authentication and Database

To enhance the application with user authentication and a real database:

1. **Authentication**: Integrate libraries like Firebase Authentication or Auth0.
2. **Database**: Use services like Firebase Firestore, MongoDB, or PostgreSQL.
3. **API Integration**: Replace dummy JSON data with real API endpoints for products and user data.

### Styling

Tailwind CSS is highly customizable. Modify `tailwind.config.js` to add custom themes, colors, or extend existing utilities.

### State Management

For more complex state management, consider integrating Redux or Context API to manage global states effectively.
